# Aminoacids_frequency
Frequencies of Amino Acids per each gene in fasta format:
One can simply count the total number of each amino-acid per each gene (after converting DNA triple codons into aminoacids or just simply obtain the protein sequence for each gene) and report their frequencies per each gene as a table

To get the table of frequencies this python scripts should be run together with file.fasta and output.csv arguments as follow:

python codon_frequency.py Example.fsa output.csv
